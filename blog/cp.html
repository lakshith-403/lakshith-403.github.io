                I'm not really good at this writing thing but I'm gonna keep
                writing whatever comes to my mind. What I want to talk about is
                the state of Competitive Programming with the advancements in
                LLMs. What encouraged me to write this was the last IEEExtreme
                (18.0).
            </p>

            <h2>IEEExtreme 18.0</h2>
            <p>
                This was my second time participating in IEEExtreme. The first
                time was the year before and it was an okay experience. My team
                did not do well but got around 150th in world. This time we
                improved a bit and got around 75th in world. But before the
                final results were released, at the end of the contest our rank
                was 200+. That was really depressing. While trying to solve
                problems, I felt like the problems were so hard. I mean, I don't
                care about the problems being hard, but it seemed like my
                relative performance was much worse than last year. I read some
                problems and think, "hmm this is a hard Q, gonna take some time
                to solve." Then I check the leaderboard and see lots of people
                with full scores. I was like, "damn I'm dumb". If you think I
                have a superiority complex, I don't know, maybe? I'm not
                perfect. But this felt out of the ordinary. Usually there are
                some usual team names on the top of the leaderboard. Variance is
                not that high. A couple of new names will push others around
                each year. But this year, almost all top scorers were pushed
                down. New names occupied the top.
            </p>

            <h2>LLMs in Competitive Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Then I suspected maybe people are using LLMs. Claude was really
                good at coding even back then. And OpenAI just released GPT-O1.
                Their first reasoning model and it was crazy good. And
                competitive programming seems like something an LLM should be
                good at. Because Competitive Programming problems are
                well-defined algorithmic problems with definitive tests. There
                was a problem I was stuck on and I tried with GPT-O1. And it
                almost one-shotted it??? ("Almost" because I may have explained
                my current approach"). That was crazy. I checked the rules of
                IEEExtreme and they mentioned that the usage of LLMs is allowed.
                Then I kept using the help of LLMs for the rest of the contest.
            </p>

            <h2>Personal feelings</h2>
            <p>
                I was really depressed about it though. Because it seemed like
                LLMs were smarter than me. And with just some "hand holding" I
                could make LLMs code instead of me. The competitive programming
                community in Sri Lanka is not that big. So I should be probably
                above average. If LLMs are better than the average
                undergraduate, there's no competition here. It's just prompt
                engineering. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit. Although I
                think at the time of writing this, state-of-the-art reasoning
                models are so much better than the best competitive programmers
                here. So I don't really know what's going to happen in next
                IEEExtreme. I haven't done competitive programming in a while
                because it feels useless.
            </p>

            <h2>Being Optimistic</h2>
            <p>
                I found this blog post from a legendary grandmaster in
                Codeforces:
                <a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/133949"
                    >On AI ruining "solving math problems with computer"</a
                >
            </p>
            <p>It's a really good read. Check it out. And also the comments.</p>

            <blockquote>

                    It's like chess, even though engines are much stronger and
                    some people cheat to gain rating points online but it didn't
                    stop genuine players to stop playing. They still play for
                    love of the game.

            <p>
                I obviously think that there are so many benefits of doing
                competitive programming. They improve your computational
                thinking etc. But competing seems pointless. I'm gonna get back
                to it when I have time. But most probably I won't compete again
                in IEEExtreme.
